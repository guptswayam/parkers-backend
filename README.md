# The problem it solves
You do not always know, if you go out for a party, to a restaurant or to a hotel, whether you'd be getting a secure parking spot for you vehicle, how much would it cost or how far would it be from where you'd be staying for the time being. And believe it or not, but this is another level of headache. However, with parkers, you don't have to worry about anything save what you should wear when you go out. Because, we have already designed a system that would allow you to choose your parking lot, even before you set out. Book your lot, pay for it, and park your car. It's all automated.

# Challenges we ran into
**The biggest challenge was to manage late arrivals, what time interval to allow, and how to cancel their booking after a certain time**
The **solution** of this problem was to detect whether a vehicle has arrived within the time interval allowed (30 minutes in this case),  and cancel the booking, if the car does not arrive within the interval. The number plate detection system will constantly check for all the vehicles expected at a fixed time and will confirm if they have arrived or not. The booking of the vehicles will automatically be discarded if their arrival hasn't been confirmed within the time interval allowed.
